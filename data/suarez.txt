Absolutely astonishing from Suarez! Suarecito!
This finish from Suarez is millimeter perfect! It's down to a pixel!
Suarez peels away from his defenders like skin on a tangerine and says, "Let's have a disco tonight!"
Suarez draws his defenders in, and the finish is cleaner than Neutrogena!
Suarez is in this one quicker, and you see his feet moving like the blades of a combine harvester!
Suarez has a lot of decisions to make, and he does it instamatically!
They do not pick Suarez up here! It's like trying to pick up water!
Suarez places this one more beautifully than a mother kisses her child at night!
